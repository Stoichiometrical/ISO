**Customer Insights**

**Segment Analysis**

Our customer base can be broadly segmented into three distinct groups:

* **High Value:** These customers generate a significant amount of monetary value and are predicted to have a high probability of being alive (remaining active). Their average predicted purchases and estimated monetary value are $0.398 and $291.81, respectively.

* **Nurture:** These customers have a moderate amount of monetary value and a slightly lower probability of being alive. Their average predicted purchases and estimated monetary value are $0.356 and $300.48, respectively.

* **Risk:** These customers have the lowest monetary value and probability of being alive. However, their average predicted purchases are the highest at $0.448. This indicates that they have the potential to generate more revenue if they remain active.

**Subsegment Analysis**

Within each segment, we have identified subsegments based on their CLV (Customer Lifetime Value):

* **High CLV:** These customers are predicted to generate a high amount of revenue over their lifetime. They typically have a high probability of being alive and make multiple purchases.

* **Medium CLV:** These customers are predicted to generate a moderate amount of revenue. They have a slightly lower probability of being alive and make fewer purchases than High CLV customers.

* **Low CLV:** These customers are predicted to generate the lowest amount of revenue. They have a lower probability of being alive and make the fewest purchases.
